# Facial-Emotion-Recognition

The goal of this project is to classify images of human faces into one of seven basic emotions. To do so, I used **Convolutional Neural Networks** as the advantage it had over its precedessors is that it can automatically detect important features without human intervention. CNNs are computationally efficient as well due to the special convolution and pooling operations.

## The Model:

The model used for this project is shown below. It consists of an input layer, three hidden layers, a flatten layer and finally an output layer.
